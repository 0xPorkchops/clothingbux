# ClothingBux
This project has been discontinued since Roblox added the 10 Robux fee to upload clothing, making it economically unviable.

This bot scraped avatar clothing from Roblox, reuploaded them to Roblox groups, and set them for sale on the Roblox marketplace.

This bot utilized:
 
Object-oriented design using Python
 
BeautifulSoup and Selenium for automation
 
Pickle for session handling
 
Anti-Captcha API for solving captcha requests
 
Socks5 proxies for IP obfuscation
 
Debian Virtual Machines for cost savings and high uptime
